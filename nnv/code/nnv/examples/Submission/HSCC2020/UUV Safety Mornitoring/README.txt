This file provides a brief explanation of how to run the safety monitoring experiment of a UUV.

To reproduce results, follow the following steps:

1) Download all the files and add them to the same folder.

2) Make sure you have nnv downloaded (git clone --recursive https://github.com/verivital/nnv.git).

3) Run the install.m file (in the nnv/code subfolder).

4) Run reach_run.n (inside the folder created with this code). The RUNTIME IS ABOUT 20 MINUTES.

5) The result obtained should be the same as in the picture "safety_monitoring.png".
