NOTE***: To run ACC case study, we need to have CORA installed. 

1) Install NNV: 

        a) git clone --recursive https://github.com/verivital/nnv.git

        b) go to ..code/nnv/ folder to run install.m

2) Run ACC case study: 

        a) Run ACC with discrete linear plant model: 

           a1) using exact analysis: run  verify_discrete_ACC_exact_star.m

               total runtime is about 5.5 hours

           a2) using approximate analysis: run verify_discrete_ACC_approx_star.m

               total runtime is about 4 minutes

        b) Run ACC with nonlinear plant model using approx-star method

           run verify_nonlinear_ACC.m 

           total runtime is about 30 minutes

NOTE***: 

We use 4 cores for computation. If your computer does not have >= 4 cores

Set numCores (or n_cores) parameter (default = 4) in the script to a suitable number
