\section{Introduction}

This is a short document describing some insights into using MetiTarski based on
my experiences using it extensively during both my master's and PhD degrees.

\section{Tips}

\subsection{Coding Suggestions}

The modified TPTP syntax that MetiTarski uses is definitely not easy on the
eyes. My recommendation is to use Emacs along with a custom built mode
(metit-mode) for syntax highlighting. It is available at
\url{https://code.google.com/p/metitarski/wiki/MetiTarskiMode}. Emacs also does bracket identification and completion, which you will most surely need for complicated (and large) conjectures. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Use the \texttt{.tptp} extension for your MetiTarski files.

\item Whitespace is ignored by the parser, use it to nicely format longer formulas.

\item MetiTarski variable names must be uppercase.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{High Variable/Dimensional Problems}

Beyond 4 or 5 continuous variables, there is very little hope for MetiTarski in
finding a proof. However, there is one critical command line argument when used
with the z3 EADM, that has allowed for conjectures of 9 variables to be
proved. This is the \texttt{--RCFtime} parameter. Experiments show that an RCFtime of
1000 (ms) leads to a nice balance between conjectures proved and conjectures
given up on.

\subsection{False Implies Anything}

Always be wary when a conjecture that has never been proved or usually takes a
significant amount of time, suddenly is proved in under a second. This normally
indicates the problem has been made trivial in some way. One example is a false
statement in the left hand side of an implication. MetiTarski will return
Theorem for $![X] : X<0 \; \& \; X>0 => X=0$, since false implies anything.

\subsection{autoInclude}

One of the most useful command line arguments is \texttt{--autoInclude}. I've used it
extensively in my verification system QUANTUM that generates thousands of
conjectures to be proved. Instead of having to parse the conjectures and
manually insert \texttt{include} statements. MetiTarski takes care of this
automatically. There are cases however where the axioms chosen by autoInclude
are not tight enough. In a case like this, you can move on to using
\texttt{--autoIncludeExtended} and then \texttt{--autoIncludeSuperExtended}. Finally, if
the conjecture is still not proved, manually putting in the include statements
will be required.

\textit{Note}:  \texttt{include} statements must end with a period.


\subsection{runmetit.pl}

The easiest way to use the \texttt{runmetit} script is to place it on your \$PATH. To run
it with \texttt{autoInclude} and \texttt{RCFtime}, type

\begin{verbatim}
  runmetit.pl --options="--autoInclude --RCFtime 1000"
\end{verbatim}

Good luck! And please contact the team with tips of your own..
