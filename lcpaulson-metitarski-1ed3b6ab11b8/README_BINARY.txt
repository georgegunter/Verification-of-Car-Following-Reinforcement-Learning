Welcome to MetiTarski! Suggestions and bug reports are welcomed.

Please consult doc/MetiTarski_User_Guide.pdf for details of how to build
and run MetiTarski. This README_BINARY.txt file contains extra details pertinent to
setting up the precompiled binary version of the program.

INSTALLING THE PRECOMPILED BINARY OF METITARSKI

The tarball should contain the following files

README_BINARY.txt - this file
metit - the binary version of MetiTarski
libpolyml.so.3 - the Poly/ML library needed to run metit
libgmp.so.3 - GMP library needed to run metit
z3 - a binary of z3 for non-commercial use (see README.txt)

and two directories

scripts - various perl scripts described in README.txt
tptp - containing the Axiom and Problem files in two sub-directories (see README.txt for more detail)

For metit to run environment variables need to be set. This is probably best done in a login file such as .bashrc.

Assuming that the tarball has been expanded into a single directory a suitable environment variable can be set to point to this:

export METITARSKI= full path of the directory where the files have been placed

For the libpolyml.so.3 and libgmp.so.3 files to be found the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH (DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for Macs) needs to be extended to point at the directory. (On some systems, such as early versions of Ubuntu it may be necessary to add the path to a configuration file which is placed in directory /etc/ld.so.conf.d. The configuration file then is activated using ldconfig. These commands may require the use of sudo to have the right permissions. See below for more details.)

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$METITARSKI

It is also useful to extend the PATH environment variable to point to where metit is:

export PATH=$PATH:$METITARSKI

For Z3 to be found the environment variable Z3_NONLIN (see README.txt) needs to be set (NB this
must contain the full path to the Z3 binary):

export Z3_NONLIN=$METITARSKI/z3

Finally, to save using --tptp in the metit command line the environment variable TPTP can be set (this allows the Axiom files to be found)

export TPTP=$METITARSKI/tptp

SETTING A LINK TO THE PERL SCRIPTS

To run the perl script runmetit.pl a symbolic link should be used rather than copying the file as it needs to access other scripts within the scripts subdirectory.

e.g. (from the problem file directory)

ln -s $METITARSKI/scripts/runmetit.pl ./runmetit.pl

Alternatively, the PATH environment variable can be further extended to point at the scripts directory

export PATH=$PATH:$METITARSKI/scripts


INSTALLING ON EARLIER VERSIONS OF UBUNTU

Some versions of Ubuntu and other Debian based Linux operating system use configuration files rather than LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  The user must in this case place the full path to the MetiTarski directory (i.e. the directory containing the library files used by MetiTarski - libpolyml.so.3 and libgmp.so.3) into a txt file named MetiTarski.conf (for instance).

The text file should be created in the directory /etc/ld.so.conf.d

The configuration is then activated with the command ldconfig.

Super user privileges may be required so the command sudo should be used. An example series of commands are:

cd /etc/ld.so.conf.d

sudo emacs metit.conf

(add the full path to the file metit.conf and save and exit)

sudo ldconfig
